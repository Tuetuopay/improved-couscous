# C++Ube -- name subject to change

This is my own shot at a simple yet efficient game engine. Right now, it is more
of a OpenGL playground than a real engine, but heh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Compiling

U kidding ?

	make

Seriously though, this is dependent on the following libraries :

- GLEW
- GLM
- GLFW

That's all folks :)

# TODO

- Text engine
- More camera controllers (trackball mostly)
- GUIs ?
- Better Shader abstraction
- Model loading
- Backends other than GLFW : SDL2, (free)GLUT, ...

# Contribution

Fork, branch, pull request.

Coding style :

- K&R (with slight variations)
- Indents : tabs, but align with spaces
- lowerCamelCase and CamelCase
